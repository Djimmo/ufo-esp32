# Operating Instructions

The UFO device may only be operated with a USB power adapter with a voltage of 5V and at least a 2A (max. 3A) DC. Only use power adapters that are legally approved for the respective country.

Connecting the UFO device to your PC or laptop requires a special development environment, which is permitted only to trained developers. The user is liable for any possible damage to the PC or UFO.

Avoid using USB extension cables, as this may lead to the UFO being damaged or displaying unwanted behaviour.

Assembly of the UFO (in particular mounting the device on the ceiling) may only be carried out by qualified personnel.

The UFO is to be used exclusively in interior spaces.
