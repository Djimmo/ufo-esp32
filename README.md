# Dynatrace UFO
The 2nd generation of the Dynatrace UFO runs now with ESP32 microcontroller [(specs)](doc/SPECS.md). Also, since not everyone has the time print, solder and assemble themselves, we have produced a limited batch of ufos for your convienience. [https://dynatrace.com/ufo

# How can i foster a DevOps culture with the Dynatrace UFO?
## See the status of your CI and DevOps process in real-time
For companies that face the challenges of a distributed team, the Dynatrace DevOps UFO is a highly visible IoT gadget to share the status of a project. Using our UFOs, a quick stroll through the office, or a glance to the other side of the room, can alert you to problems.
## Improve quality and protect digital performance
The UFO monitors progress at every stage of the continuous delivery process, with a separate device for each team or feature. If there are issues that impact getting a build completed, such as code that doesn’t compile, the LEDs turn red.

## Any other visualization need...
Since the UFO has an open REST interface you can use it freely for any other visualization need. For the nerds amongst you, the UFO is also open source. So at your own risk, you are free to hack the UFO for any of your own visualization needs.
